## **Agentic AI Based Financial Advisor System**

### **1. Objective of the Task**

The objective of this project is to design and implement an **Agentic AI–based Financial Advisor system** that analyzes current stock market data and provides **short-term and long-term investment recommendations** using a multi-agent architecture.

The key objectives of the system are:

* To collect real-time historical market data for selected stocks
* To perform technical analysis using indicators such as Moving Averages, RSI, and Volatility
* To evaluate market risk using quantitative risk metrics
* To leverage an open-source Large Language Model (LLM) for investment decision-making
* To generate a structured, explainable financial advisory report
* To demonstrate the concept of **agentic AI**, where multiple autonomous agents collaborate to solve a complex task

Additional features included in the solution:

* Robust handling of unreliable LLM outputs
* Modular agent-based architecture
* Persistent memory using SQLite database

---

### **2. Framework Used – Agentic AI Architecture**

This solution is built using a **custom Agentic AI framework**, where the system is composed of multiple independent agents, each responsible for a specific task. The agents operate sequentially under the control of an orchestrator.

#### **Advantages**

* Clear separation of responsibilities
* Easy to extend (new agents like sentiment analysis can be added)
* Better explainability compared to monolithic AI models
* Fault tolerance (failure of one agent does not collapse the entire system)

#### **Disadvantages**

* Slightly higher execution time due to multiple agents
* Requires careful coordination between agents
* LLM outputs may be inconsistent and need validation

The system uses **open-source tools only**, including:

* Python
* Ollama (LLaMA3 model)
* SQLite
* yFinance
* Pandas and NumPy

---

### **3. System Architecture and Workflow**

The system follows a **pipeline-based agent workflow** controlled by an orchestrator.

#### **Overall Workflow**

1. Market data is fetched
2. Technical indicators are calculated
3. Risk metrics are computed
4. LLM generates investment strategies
5. Final advisory report is produced

### **4. Explanation of Agents**

#### **4.1 Market Data Agent**

* Fetches historical stock price data using the `yfinance` library
* Stores adjusted closing prices in an SQLite database
* Acts as the data ingestion layer

**Output:** Market price table (`market_data`)

---

#### **4.2 Technical Analysis Agent**

* Computes technical indicators such as:

  * 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA)
  * 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA)
  * Relative Strength Index (RSI)
  * Volatility (rolling standard deviation)
* Performs calculations independently for each stock

**Output:** Technical analysis table (`technical_analysis`)

---

#### **4.3 Risk Analysis Agent**

* Evaluates financial risk using:

  * Annualized volatility
  * Maximum drawdown
* Helps quantify downside risk before making investment decisions

**Output:** Risk metrics table (`risk_analysis`)

---

#### **4.4 Strategy Agent (LLM Agent)**

* Uses an open-source LLM (LLaMA3 via Ollama)
* Takes technical and risk indicators as input
* Generates:

  * Short-term recommendation (Buy/Sell/Hold)
  * Long-term recommendation (Buy/Sell/Hold)
  * Confidence score
  * Reason for the recommendation

To handle unreliable LLM outputs, a **safe JSON parsing mechanism** is implemented. If the LLM output is invalid, the system gracefully falls back to a default recommendation.

---

#### **4.5 Report Agent**

* Aggregates outputs from all agents
* Produces a human-readable financial advisory report
* Stores and prints the final report

---

### **5. Orchestrator**

The orchestrator is responsible for:

* Initializing agents
* Executing them in the correct order
* Managing shared context and database connection
* Ensuring successful completion of the pipeline

This central control ensures coordination while preserving agent independence.

### **6. Execution Instructions**

#### **Prerequisites**

* Python 3.x
* Ollama installed with `llama3` model
* Internet connection for market data

#### **Steps to Run**

1. Install dependencies:

   ```
   pip install pandas numpy yfinance requests
   ```
2. Ensure Ollama is running (API mode):

   ```
   ollama serve
   ```
3. Run the program:

   ```
   python advisor.py
   ```
4. The final report is printed in the console and stored in the SQLite database.

### **7. Conclusion**

This project demonstrates how **Agentic AI** can be effectively applied to financial advisory systems. By combining deterministic financial analysis with probabilistic LLM reasoning, the system provides explainable, robust, and extensible investment recommendations. The modular agent-based design makes the solution suitable for real-world extensions such as portfolio optimization and sentiment analysis.
